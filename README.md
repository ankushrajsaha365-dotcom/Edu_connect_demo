# EduConnect 🎓

**EduConnect** is a role-based frontend prototype of an education platform where students learn, teachers teach, and qualified students earn through part-time teaching.

The project focuses on **clean UI**, **role-based access**, and **realistic platform behavior**, built using pure **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a browser
3. Use the navigation to register, login, and explore dashboards

No server setup required.

## 🔒 Role-Based Access Logic

* Dashboard modules are shown/hidden based on role
* Direct URL access is blocked for unauthorized roles
* Session is simulated using `localStorage`

This structure is **backend-ready** and can be easily connected to an API later.
